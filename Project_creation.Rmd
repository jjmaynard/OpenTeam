Steps to create R projects:
1.	Navigate to directory that will host the project folder.
2.	In R, load ‘rrtools’ and ‘workflowr’
3.	Run ‘rrtools’ code to create research compendium:
a.	rrtools::use_compendium("myproject ")
b.	usethis::use_mit_license(name = "Jonathan J Maynard")
c.	usethis::use_git()
d.	Create github ‘repo’ token for “myproject”
e.	usethis::use_github(auth_token = "xxxx", protocol = "https", private = FALSE)
f.	rrtools::use_readme_rmd()
g.	rrtools::use_analysis()
h.	rename the ‘analysis’ folder to ‘report’
i.	rrtools::use_dockerfile()
j.	rrtools::use_travis()
4.	Run ‘workflowr’ code to create research website
a.	wflow_start("myproject_site")
b.	wflow_build() and wflow_view() to build and view website
c.	wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"), "Publish the initial files for myproject")
d.	wflow_status() to check if docs have been published
5.	Integreate rrtools folder and workflow folder:
a.	Move items from "myproject_site" to "myproject "
6.	Commit changes with Git and push to GitHub. All future changes can be pushed to

# Modify this section for each new project
```{r}
# set project name and path
name <- "OpenTeam"
path <- "C:/R_Drive/Data_Files/LPKS_Data/R_Projects/OpenTeam"
```

```{r}
# set workflowr name and path
wflr_name <- paste0(name, "_site")
wflr_path <- paste0(path, "/", wflr_name)
```

```{r}
library(rrtools)
library(workflowr)
```

# Add auth_token for project

```{r}
#setwd(path)
rrtools::use_compendium(name)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "Jonathan J Maynard")
usethis::use_git()

#Create github ‘repo’ token for “myproject”
# create token
usethis::create_github_token()
# set token in storage
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
usethis::use_github(protocol = "https", private = FALSE)

rrtools::use_readme_rmd(pkg = path, render_readme = TRUE)
rrtools::use_analysis(path)
#rename the ‘analysis’ folder to ‘report’
# rrtools::use_dockerfile(path)
# rrtools::use_travis(path)
```

# Run workflowr code as chunk
```{r}
#Run ‘workflowr’ code to create research website
wflow_start(wflr_path, git = FALSE)
wflow_build() #to build  website
wflow_view()  #view website
```

# Perform these steps for workflowr sub-folder
  1. rename 'analysis' to 'site'
  2. rename "site/about.Rmd" to "site/code.Rmd"
  2. create new Rmarkdown file "site/data.Rmd"

# Run workflowr code as chunk
```{r}
setwd(wflr_path)
wflow_publish(c("site/index.Rmd", "site/code.Rmd", "site/data.Rmd", "site/license.Rmd"), "Publish the initial files for myproject")
wflow_status() #to check if docs have been published
```

#Integreate rrtools folder and workflowr folder:
Changes to rrtools folder (project folder):
  1. erase rrtools .gitignore and .profile
  2. rename analysis folder to 'report' -- already done above
  3. move report/data files to data/
  4. erase R/ folder
  5. Create 'proj_setup' folder and save Project_creation.Rmd script in this folder


Changes to workflowr folder (sub project folder):
  1. erase workflowr README.Rmd
  2. move README.Rmd in data folder to rrtools data folder and erase data folder
  3. erase workflowr Rproj file
  4. move all files from workflowr folder to main project folder, then erase workflowr folder
  5. add 'proj_setup/' to .gitignore
  6. move README.md in /output folder to data/derived/ and erase /output 
  
Commit changes with Git and push to GitHub.
In Github, set github project site to /docs in settings



```{r}
setwd(path)
wflow_publish(c("site/index.Rmd", "site/code.Rmd", "site/data.Rmd", "site/license.Rmd"), "Publish the initial files for myproject")
wflow_status() #to check if docs have been published
```


##Examples for making changes to project website with workflowr
```{r}
#Check if any docs have not yet been published
wflow_status() 
# single file
wflow_publish("site/file.Rmd", "Informative commit message")
# All tracked files that have been edited
wflow_publish(all = TRUE, message = "Informative commit message")
# A new file plus all tracked files that have been edited
wflow_publish("site/file.Rmd", "Informative commit message", all = TRUE)
# Multiple files
wflow_publish(c("site/file.Rmd", "site/another.Rmd"),
              "Informative commit message")
# All R Markdown files that start with the pattern "new_"
wflow_publish("site/new_*Rmd", "Informative commit message")
# Republish all published files even though they haven't been modified.
# Useful for changing some universal aspect of the site, e.g. the theme
# specified in _site.yml.
wflow_publish("site/_site.yml", "site update", republish = TRUE)
# Publish all previously published files that have been committed more
# recently than their corresponding HTML files. This is useful if you like to
# manually commit your R Markdown files.
wflow_publish(update = TRUE)

wflow_publish("site/index.Rmd", all = TRUE, message = "Update index")
wflow_publish("site/ESG_Covariate_Processing.Rmd", all = TRUE, message = "Update ESG covariate processing")
```
